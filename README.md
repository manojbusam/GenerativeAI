### Data Science Overview

The Data Science Lifecycle is a systematic approach used by data scientists to tackle real-world problems through data-driven solutions. It typically consists of several iterative stages aimed at extracting insights, creating predictive models, and deriving actionable conclusions from data. While variations exist, a common framework involves:

## Step 1: Problem Identification and Planning
Identifying and understanding the problem or question that needs to be addressed using data. This involves defining objectives, success metrics, and outlining the scope of the project.

Scientific Methods:
- Research Methods: Surveys, interviews, literature reviews.
- Hypothesis Formulation: Defining research questions.
- Experimental Design: Structuring the approach.

## Step 2: Data Collection
Gathering relevant data from various sources, which may include databases, APIs, files, or other repositories. This step involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.

Scientific Methods:
- Observation and Measurement.
- Sampling Techniques: Random, stratified, systematic.
- Data Governance: Ensuring data integrity.

## Step 3: Data Preparation & Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and exploring the data to understand its patterns, relationships, and characteristics. This phase involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and hypothesis testing to uncover insights and trends.

Feature Engineering: Selecting, transforming, and creating relevant features from the data that will be used to train machine learning models. This step aims to improve the model's performance by highlighting important aspects of the data.

Scientific Methods:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Data Cleaning: Handling inconsistencies.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features.

## Step 4: Model Building
Building and training predictive models using various machine learning or statistical techniques. This involves selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and validating the model's performance.

Scientific Methods:
- Model Development: Implementation and training.
- Hyperparameter Tuning.
- Algorithm Selection. The below techniques come under Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Supervised Learning

- **Classification Algorithms:**
  - *Logistic Regression:* Predicts categories (spam/not spam in emails).
  - *Decision Trees:* Splits data based on features (loan approval).
  - *Random Forest:* Combines decision trees for accuracy (customer churn).
  - *Naive Bayes:* Uses probabilities for classification (news categorization).
  - *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):* Groups data based on similarity (flower species).
  - *Support Vector Machines (SVM):* Creates boundaries between classes (fraud detection).

- **Regression Algorithms:**
  - *Linear Regression:* Predicts continuous values (house prices).
  - *Ridge Regression:* Reduces overfitting in linear regression (salary estimation).
  - *Lasso Regression:* Selects features in linear regression (mileage prediction).
  - *ElasticNet:* Balances L1 and L2 regularization (sales estimation).
  - *Decision Trees (for Regression):* Predicts continuous values (used car prices).
  - *Gradient Boosting Machines:* Corrects errors sequentially (stock price forecasting).

- **Neural Network-Based:**
  - *Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):* Deep learning for complex patterns (digit recognition).
  - *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):* Specialized for images (object identification).
  - *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):* Sequences and time-series data (stock prediction).

#### Unsupervised Learning:

- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups data by similarity (customer segmentation).
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Creates clusters hierarchically (taxonomy creation).
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces data dimensions (image compression).

#### Semi-Supervised Learning:

- **Self-training:** Uses limited labeled data with unlabeled data (text classification).
- **Co-training:** Learns from multiple perspectives/views (image analysis).

#### Reinforcement Learning:

- **Q-Learning:** Decision-making in uncertain environments (game strategies).
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Deep learning for complex tasks (game AI training).

## Step 5: Model Evaluation
Assessing the performance of the developed models using evaluation metrics and validation techniques. This step helps in selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

Scientific Methods:

- Bias-Variance Analysis.

## Step 6: Model Deployment
Integrating the chosen model into the production environment, making it available for use in real-world scenarios. This involves considerations for scalability, efficiency, and monitoring its performance over time.

Scientific Methods:
- Serialisation and Deployment.
